            <p>
                I am Aung Min Khant, and I am attending in the foundation year at GUSTO College. As I am in crush with programming and technology, I would like to learn more about it. I have always been interested in how computers work and how websites are built, which led me to pursue a degree in IT. I come from a big family with my parents and three sisters which supported me to follow my dreams. They have taught me to stay determined and never give up whenever I face  problems. Now, I have a growing interest in web development, particularly in creating websites using HTML and CSS. In the future, I would like to explore artificial intelligence and its potential to solve real world problems. My goal is to become a software developer and contribute to the tech industry with my skills.

                I attended a public high school for many years but had to leave in Grade -11 due to my health problems. I decided to continue my education with GED program which doesn't need to go to school everyday. I completed the GED program earning my diploma on August 26, 2024 with a total score of 699. Soon after, I joined GUSTO College where I am currently attending the foundation year. I feel more comfortable and convenient while I am in GUSTO. So, I decided to complete my learning career and pursue a degree of IT in GUSTO.

        <h1>My Tribute to Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
        <div class="tributediv">
            <p>
                I really like Cristiano Ronaldo because of his passion and hard work. Even though he might not have as much natural talent as players like Lionel Messi and many other players, he worked really hard to become one of the best footballers in the world. He is from a small town in Portugal and had many challenges, but he never gave up. His story shows that success doesnâ€™t always come from being born with talent. It comes from putting in the work and never giving up. Watching Roanldo's progression motivated me to get better and be the best in everything I do. Watching him play makes me realize that if you keep working hard, no matter what, you can achieve your goals. His life journey has taught me that with enough effort, anything is possible.
